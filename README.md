## C - Binary trees

This was a partner project in which i learned about the details, advantages, and disadvantages of using trees as data structures. I learned about how to qualify trees as well as how to traverse them. Throughout the project, i implemented binary, binary search, AVL, and Max Binary Heap trees.
